## CoreXY Motion System

![](img/beltrouting.png)

smallXY uses the simplest possible CoreXY motion system with no crossed belt paths, stationary motors, and no unnecessary idler pulleys. Idlers are constructed from pairs of FR623ZZ ball bearings for the best balance of cost to performance. Belt tensioning is integrated into the motor mounts so that the belts can be easily tensioned by turning screws accessible from the front of the printer. The rigid frame, linear rails, and a lightweight X-axis and toolhead allow high speed and very fast accelerations (at least 6000mm/s²).

## Toolhead

The toolhead fits an E3D V6 hotend, powerful 40x40x20mm part cooling fan, and inductive probe into a very compact 46mm wide package weighing less than 100g. The inductive probe is used for Z homing and optionally bed leveling using magnets attached to the underside of the heated bed.

## Wiring

Almost all of the printer's wiring is integrated into one fully connectorized harness that attaches to the frame using 3D printed snaps and 3M dual lock.

The toolhead is connected with JST SM connectors mounted in a 3D printed part for ease of servicing. The single 12-conductor high flexibility cable is supported by a 3D printed mount to eliminate any strain on the connectors.
