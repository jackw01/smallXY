## Wiring
![](img/DSCF6918.jpg)
Almost all of the printer's wiring is integrated into one fully connectorized harness that attaches to the frame using 3D printed snaps and 3M dual lock.

[] toolhead

The toolhead is connected with JST SM connectors mounted in a 3D printed part for ease of servicing. The single 12-conductor high flexibility cable is supported by a 3D printed bracket to eliminate any strain on the connectors.

## Toolhead
The toolhead fits an E3D V6 hotend, powerful 40x40x20mm part cooling fan, and inductive probe into a very compact 46mm wide package. The inductive probe is used for Z homing and optionally bed leveling using magnets attached to the underside of the heated bed.
